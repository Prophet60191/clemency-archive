# New York State Executive Clemency Archive

**New to the project? [Start Here](./START_HERE.md) for a guided tour of our mission and documents.**


This repository contains all project files related to the digitization and analysis of the New York State Executive Clemency Records. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, publicly-accessible database for researchers, advocates, policymakers, and the public to better understand the history of executive clemency in New York.

## Project Overview

Currently, accessing data related to executive clemency in New York State is restricted to Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests, presenting a significant barrier to research. This project aims to address this problem by digitizing and cataloging executive clemency information from the state archive, making it accessible and searchable for the first time.

For a full overview of the project's mission, goals, and plan, please see the [**Clemency Archive Proposal**](./Clemency_Archive_Proposal.md).
