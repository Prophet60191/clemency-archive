## Key Objectives for this Meeting

The goal is to empower the fundraising colleague by providing:
1.  A compelling story.
2.  A credible, low-risk plan.
3.  A clear, justifiable budget (the "ask").
4.  Answers to the tough questions they will face from funders.

## 1. The Core Narrative: The "Why"

This is the story that will resonate with funders.

*   **The Problem:** Accessing clemency data in New York is a major barrier to research and reform. It’s slow, expensive, and prevents anyone from seeing the big picture.
*   **The Solution:** We will create the **only** comprehensive, public, and searchable archive of New York's clemency history. This will unlock decades of data for researchers, advocates, and journalists.
*   **The Impact:** This isn't just an archive; it's an **engine for justice reform**. It provides the evidence needed to push for fairer policies and brings transparency to a critical part of our legal system.

## 2. The Credible Plan: Building Funder Confidence

This demonstrates competence and minimizes perceived risk.

*   **Walk through the `Master_Project_Plan.md`:** Show the logical, phased approach. Emphasize that we are not trying to do everything at once.
*   **Highlight Risk Management:** Point directly to the **Pilot Testing phase** and the **double-entry verification** process.
    *   **Talking Point:** "We've built in quality control from the start. We'll test our entire workflow on a small scale before scaling up, and no piece of data gets into the final database until two different people have verified it. This is the gold standard for data transcription and ensures our data will be trustworthy."
*   **Show the `_Master_Document_Index.md`:** This proves the project is well-organized and every aspect has been considered.

## 3. The "Ask": Defining the Budget

A fundraiser cannot succeed without a clear, justifiable number.

*   **Collaborate on a budget:** Use the "Resources and Support Needs" section of the proposal as a checklist to put a dollar amount on each item.
    *   **Scanning Costs:** What is the exact cost from the NYS Archive?
    *   **Software:** What database/spreadsheet tools are needed and what is the annual cost?
    *   **Volunteer Management Tools:** (e.g., Paid Slack, Asana, etc.)
*   **Frame the ask in phases:** Propose funding for **Phases 1 and 2** first. This is a smaller, more manageable ask that covers the most critical work and makes the investment feel less daunting.

## 4. Workshop the "Funder FAQ"

Role-play the tough questions to prepare the fundraiser for any objection.

*   **Practice answers to key questions:**
    *   *"Why can't you just use interns instead of volunteers?"*
    *   *"How do you protect the privacy of the people in these records?"*
    *   *"What if you don't get enough volunteers?"*
*   **Ask your colleague:** "What are the three most common objections you hear from funders? Let's craft the perfect answers for this project right now."

### Meeting Outcome

By the end of this internal meeting, the fundraising colleague should feel like a co-owner of the project's vision, confident in its execution, and equipped with a powerful story and a concrete ask.
