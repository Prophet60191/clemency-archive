**Subject: Call for Volunteers: Help Unlock New York's Hidden History**

Dear [Name/Group],

I am writing to invite you to be part of a groundbreaking project: the New York State Executive Clemency Archive. For the first time, we are building a free, public digital archive of historical clemency records, unlocking the stories of thousands of individuals who petitioned for mercy and a second chance.

This project will be an invaluable resource for researchers, historians, genealogists, and advocates working to understand and reform our justice system. But to make it a reality, we need a dedicated team of volunteers to help us with the crucial work of data transcription.

**We are looking for detail-oriented individuals to join our team as Volunteer Transcribers.**

As a volunteer, you will work with digitized historical ledgers, transcribing key information into our database. It is a unique opportunity to engage directly with primary source documents and make a lasting contribution to public knowledge and social justice.

No prior experience is necessary, as we will provide a comprehensive data entry guide and full support from our team leads. The most important qualifications are a keen eye for detail and a commitment to accuracy.

If you are interested in learning more about this project and how you can contribute, please review our [**Project Proposal**](../../../Clemency_Archive_Proposal.md) and our [**Volunteer Role Descriptions**](./Volunteer_Role_Descriptions.md).

To express your interest or ask any questions, please reply to this email.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to help us bring this vital history to light.

Sincerely,

Jose DiLenola
RAPP Clemency Campaign Director
