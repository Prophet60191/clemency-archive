## Welcome to the Team!

We are thrilled to have you join the RAPP New York State Executive Clemency Archive project. Your contribution is essential to unlocking the stories held within these historical records. For centuries, the personal histories of New Yorkers who sought clemency have been locked away in archives. Your work will be instrumental in building a free, public database to unlock those stories for families, researchers, and policymakers for the very first time.

This document contains everything you need to get started.
