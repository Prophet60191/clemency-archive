# The Project Leader's Personal Playbook

You have the documents. This guide covers the actions, skills, and routines you'll need to actually lead the project and your team.

## 1. Your "People" Playbook (Your #1 Job)

Your project will live or die based on your volunteer team. Your most important role is Chief Engagement Officer.

### A Recognition Routine: 
This is non-negotiable. You must build a public and consistent routine for recognizing volunteer contributions.

- **Action:** In your Slack/communication channel, create a weekly "Shout-Out" post. Thank people by name. "A huge thank you to Maria for knocking out three difficult ledger pages!" "Shout-out to David for helping us spot a bug in the data entry form!"
- **Action:** Celebrate all milestones: "Team, we just passed 500 verified records! Amazing work, everyone!"

### Master the "Art of Delegation" (To Your Team Leads):
You are the Project Leader, not the Team Lead. Your job is to manage your 2-3 Team Leads. Their job is to manage the 10+ transcribers.

- **Action:** Resist the urge to jump in and answer a transcriber's question. If you see it, tag their Team Lead. This empowers your leads and protects your time.
- **Action:** Set up a 30-minute, bi-weekly (every two weeks) check-in with your Team Leads. This is your most important meeting. The only agenda items are:
    - "What's working?" (So you can double-down on it)
    - "What's stuck?" (So you can un-stick it for them)
    - "What do you need from me?"

### Be a "Friction-Absorber":
Your volunteers are doing this for free. Your job is to make their experience as smooth and rewarding as possible. When a problem arises (e.g., the data entry tool is buggy, an archival scan is unreadable), you take on the stress of fixing it.

- **Action:** Create a clear "#help" or "#problems" channel. When a volunteer posts there, your public response should always be: "Thank you for finding this! This is a huge help. I'm on it." You are the calm, appreciative center of the project.

## 2. Your "Project Management" Playbook (Your Weekly Cadence)

This is how you stay on top of the project without getting overwhelmed.

### The "Sacred Hour" (Your Weekly Review):

- **Action:** Block one hour on your calendar, same time every week (e.g., Friday afternoon or Sunday evening). This hour is non-negotiable. During this time, you:
    - Open the Master Assignment Tracker: Where are the bottlenecks? Is Transcriber A 10 pages ahead of Transcriber B?
    - Open the Risk Register: Are any of your "Medium" risks turning into "High" risks?
    - Open the Budget Tracker: How's your burn rate on hosting?
    - Review your Leader's Guide checklist: What's the one big goal for next week?
    - Draft your "Weekly Recognition" post.

### The "Firewall" for Your Time:
You will be tempted to do the work yourself. "It's faster if I just do this data entry." This is a trap.

Your time is the project's most valuable resource. It must be spent on high-leverage work: recruiting, unblocking your Team Leads, communicating with funders, and promoting the project.

- **Action:** The only "in the trenches" work you should do is to test a new workflow or understand a problem. Your main job is to enable others to do the work.

## 3. Your "Stakeholder" Playbook (Managing Up & Out)

This is how you manage everyone outside your volunteer team.

### The "3-Bullet Funder Update":
Your grant funders are your allies, but they are busy. Don't make them chase you for an update.

- **Action:** Proactively send them a quarterly email update. It should have three short bullet points:
    - Last Quarter's Big Win: (e.g., "We onboarded 15 volunteers and verified 1,000 records.")
    - Next Quarter's Goal: (e.g., "We are on track to complete the 19th-century ledgers.")
    - A "Thank You" or "Highlight": (e.g., "The data is already showing fascinating trends...")

This builds immense trust and makes them more likely to fund "Version 2.0."

### Nurture Your "Champions":
Who will use this data? Find them now.

- **Action:** Identify 3-5 "dream users" of your archive (e.g., a specific legal historian, a data journalist at a NY paper, a policy-maker).
- **Action:** Send them a 3-paragraph email: "Hi [Name], I'm leading a project to... We're 6 months from launch, and I'd love to get your 'wish list' for what would make this data most useful to you." This does two things: 1) It ensures your website is built for real users, and 2) It gives them a sense of ownership, making them your biggest promoters at launch.

### Your "Public Story" (The Elevator Pitch):
You are the project's chief evangelist. You need a 30-second, passionate, non-technical story.

- **Bad Pitch:** "We're using a double-entry verification workflow and a PostgreSQL database to digitize archival clemency records." (This is how you do it, not why).
- **Good Pitch:** "For over 200 years, the personal stories of New Yorkers who sought clemency have been locked away in an archive. We're building a free, public database to unlock those stories—for families, for researchers, and for policy-makers—for the very first time."

- **Action:** Practice this pitch. You'll use it for funders, for volunteers, for journalists, and for your family at Thanksgiving.

## 4. Your "Administrator" Playbook (The 'Boring' but Critical)

### Fiscal Sponsor Management:
Unless you are your own 501(c)(3) nonprofit, you likely have a "fiscal sponsor" (e.g., a university, a larger nonprofit) that manages your grant money.

- **Action:** Understand their rules. What is their overhead fee? How do you submit an invoice for reimbursement? Who is your point of contact? A bad relationship here can stop your project cold.

### The "Subscription & Renewal" Tracker:

- **Action:** Create a simple spreadsheet with all your recurring costs (domain name, web hosting, Slack Pro, etc.) and their renewal dates. This prevents the "Your website is down!" panic when the domain expires.
