# Data Visualization Strategy

**Purpose:** This document outlines the strategy and potential ideas for creating data visualizations to tell compelling stories with the Clemency Archive data. The goal is to make the data accessible, understandable, and impactful for a public audience.

---

## 1. Core Principles

*   **Narrative First:** Every visualization should tell a clear, human-centered story.
*   **Context is Key:** Visualizations should be accompanied by clear, concise explanations of what the data represents and its historical context.
*   **Transparency:** We will be transparent about the data's limitations and any ambiguities in the historical record.

## 2. Potential Visualization Ideas (To Be Developed)

This is a brainstorming list of potential visualizations to explore once the dataset is sufficiently populated.

*   **Geographic Mapping:**
    *   A map of New York State showing the number of clemency applications or grants by county of conviction.
    *   Could reveal geographic disparities in the justice system.

*   **Timeline Analysis:**
    *   A timeline showing the number of clemency grants per year, overlaid with the tenure of different governors.
    *   Could reveal how different administrations approached the use of clemency power.

*   **Demographic & Conviction Data:**
    *   Bar charts or pie charts showing the most common conviction types for which clemency was sought or granted.
    *   Analysis of sentence lengths (e.g., a histogram showing the distribution of sentence lengths for applicants).
    *   *Note: This is highly dependent on the availability and quality of demographic data in the source records.*

*   **Network Analysis:**
    *   A network graph showing connections between individuals, such as lawyers or advocates who represented multiple applicants.
    *   Could reveal influential figures or organizations in the history of clemency advocacy.

## 3. Technical Implementation (To Be Determined)

*   **Potential Tools:** [e.g., Tableau Public, Flourish, Datawrapper, custom D3.js visualizations]
*   **Integration:** Visualizations will be embedded directly into the project website to create interactive, narrative-driven pages.
