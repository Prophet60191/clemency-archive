# Data Security & Management Plan

**Purpose:** This document outlines the official policies and procedures for managing, securing, and preserving all data collected and generated by the Clemency Archive Project.

---

## 1. Data Classification

All project data is classified into one of two categories:

*   **Public Data:** Data intended for public display. This includes anonymized, aggregated data and any records explicitly cleared for public release.
*   **Sensitive/Private Data:** Any data containing personally identifiable information (PII), non-public details of a case, or any information that has not been explicitly cleared for public release. **This is the default classification for all raw data.**

## 2. Data Storage & Location

*   **Raw Scans & Transcripts (Private):**
    *   **Primary Storage:** [e.g., Encrypted folder in Google Drive, Secure cloud storage bucket]
    *   **Description:** This is the primary, secure location for all raw digital assets. Access is strictly controlled.

*   **Production Database (Private):**
    *   **Provider:** [e.g., AWS RDS, Heroku Postgres]
    *   **Security:** The database will be configured to only accept connections from the production application server. Direct external access is prohibited.

*   **Backups (Private):**
    *   **Frequency:** The production database is backed up **daily** at 2:00 AM Eastern Time.
    *   **Retention:** Backups are retained for 30 days and then automatically deleted.
    *   **Location:** Backups are stored in a separate, secure, access-controlled cloud storage location.

## 3. Access Control Policy

Access to data is governed by the principle of **least privilege**.

*   **Level 3 (Project Leader):** Full administrative access to all project data, storage systems, and databases.
    *   *Current Holder: Jose DiLenola*

*   **Level 2 (Team Leads/Developers):** Access to specific datasets and systems required for their role (e.g., access to the production database for maintenance). Does not include access to raw PII unless explicitly required and approved.
    *   *Current Holders: [List Names/Roles]*

*   **Level 1 (Volunteers):** Access only to the specific, anonymized data required for their assigned task (e.g., transcription or verification). Volunteers will never have direct access to the full raw dataset.

## 4. Data Breach Response Plan

In the event of a suspected or confirmed data breach, the following steps will be taken immediately:

1.  **Containment:** The affected system will be immediately isolated to prevent further unauthorized access (e.g., by rotating all credentials, blocking IP addresses, or taking the system offline).
2.  **Assessment:** The Project Leader will immediately begin an assessment to determine the scope of the breach: what data was accessed, and how the breach occurred.
3.  **Notification:** The Project Leader will notify the RAPP campaign leadership and any relevant institutional partners within 24 hours of confirming the breach.
4.  **Remediation:** The security vulnerability that allowed the breach will be identified and patched immediately.
5.  **Post-Mortem:** A full report will be written detailing the cause of the breach, the response taken, and the steps implemented to prevent a recurrence.
