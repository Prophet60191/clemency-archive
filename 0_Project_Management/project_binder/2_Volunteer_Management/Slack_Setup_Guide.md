## Recommended Slack Channel Structure

Clear channels are key to a productive and uncluttered workspace. Here is the recommended channel setup for the Clemency Archive project.

### General Channels

*   `#general`
    *   **Purpose:** For project-wide announcements from the Project Leader. All team members will be in this channel. (It's best to keep chatter here to a minimum so announcements don't get lost).

*   `#introductions`
    *   **Purpose:** A place for new volunteers to introduce themselves when they first join. A great way to build community.

*   `#random`
    *   **Purpose:** For non-work-related chat, sharing interesting articles, and general community building. This helps keep other channels focused on the work.

### Work-Related Channels

*   `#data-questions`
    *   **Purpose:** This is the most important channel for our daily work. Volunteers should post any questions they have about the data entry process here (e.g., "I can't read this handwriting, can someone else take a look?" or "What does this abbreviation mean?").
    *   **Who Answers:** Team Leads are the primary responders in this channel. This empowers them and allows the Project Leader to focus on higher-level tasks.

*   `#technical-help`
    *   **Purpose:** For any issues related to the tools we're using (e.g., "The spreadsheet is not loading for me," or "I'm having trouble with my login.").

*   `#shout-outs`
    *   **Purpose:** A dedicated channel for celebrating successes and recognizing the great work of our volunteers. The Project Leader should post here at least weekly to thank individuals by name and celebrate milestones (e.g., "Huge shout-out to Maria for finishing 10 ledger pages this week!").

### Team-Specific Channels (Optional, but Recommended)

As the team grows, you may want to create private channels for specific teams.

*   `#team-leads`
    *   **Purpose:** A private channel for the Project Leader and the 2-3 Team Leads. This is where you can discuss volunteer progress, address challenges, and coordinate assignments.

*   `#team-alpha`, `#team-bravo`, etc.
    *   **Purpose:** If you have multiple Team Leads, you can create separate channels for each lead and their assigned group of transcribers. This can make management more focused.

This structure will help keep our communication organized, ensure questions are answered efficiently, and build a strong sense of community within the project.
