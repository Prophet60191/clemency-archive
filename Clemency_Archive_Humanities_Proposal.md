# The New York State Executive Clemency Archive: A Proposal for a Digital Humanities Project


---

## Project as a Digital Humanities Initiative

This project is, at its core, a **Digital Humanities** initiative dedicated to the recovery, preservation, and public dissemination of historical narratives. We are not simply creating a database; we are building a **narrative archive of the human experience at the intersection of justice, mercy, and power.** By transforming fragile, inaccessible physical records into a dynamic digital resource, we are making a major contribution to **Public History**. We are democratizing access to primary source documents that have been effectively locked away, enabling a new generation of students, historians, genealogists, and citizen-scholars to engage directly with the historical record in a way that has never been possible.

Each record in this archive represents a human story—a story of a crime, a conviction, and a plea for a second chance. Collectively, these micro-stories form a powerful macro-narrative about who we, as a society, chose to forgive, when, and why. This project preserves the **historical memory** of thousands of New Yorkers, restoring a voice to individuals who have largely been rendered invisible in the historical record.

## Project Summary

The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, publicly accessible digital archive of New York State executive clemency information. Currently housed in physical ledgers within the state archive, these records contain the rich, untold stories of individuals petitioning for mercy. By digitizing and structuring these primary sources, we will create a platform for new forms of **humanistic inquiry** and make this vital part of New York's history accessible to a broad audience for the first time. This initiative moves beyond simple data analysis to facilitate a deeper understanding of the human experience within the justice system.

## Target Population

While this archive will be a vital tool for legal scholars and policy advocates, its primary audience from a humanities perspective includes:

*   **Historians and Students:** Scholars and students of social history, legal history, and New York State history.
*   **Genealogists and Families:** Individuals seeking to uncover their own family histories and connect with the lives of their ancestors.
*   **Digital Humanists:** Researchers who can use this structured dataset for innovative computational analysis and data visualization projects.
*   **The General Public:** Any citizen interested in exploring the personal stories that make up the history of justice and mercy in their state.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the narratives contained within New York State's executive clemency records are silenced by their format. Access is restricted to arduous Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests, a process that makes large-scale historical or narrative analysis impossible. This project addresses this critical gap by transforming these records from a static, inaccessible collection into a dynamic, interactive public resource. We will unlock the stories and data needed to explore profound humanistic questions about how justice, power, and mercy have been administered and experienced over centuries.

## Objectives

*   **Preserve and Digitize Historical Narratives:** Convert the fragile physical records of the New York State Executive Clemency archive into a permanent and stable digital format.
*   **Create a Publicly Accessible Digital Humanities Platform:** Develop a user-friendly online archive that allows both scholars and the public to search, browse, and engage with the individual stories and historical data.
*   **Enable New Forms of Historical Inquiry:** Structure the data to allow for both qualitative (narrative-based) and quantitative analysis of historical trends in justice and mercy.
*   **Promote Public Engagement with History:** Foster a deeper public understanding of the human stories behind the justice system and the historical evolution of clemency.

## Key Activities

*   **Preservation of Primary Sources:** Procure high-quality digital scans of the clemency records from the New York State Archives.
*   **Structuring Historical Data for Humanistic Inquiry:** Meticulously transcribe the narrative and statistical data from the scanned records into a structured format suitable for a searchable database.
*   **Developing a Public-Facing Digital Platform:** Build an online archive to host the structured data, providing user-friendly search, filtering, and browsing functionalities to encourage exploration.
*   **Engaging the Scholarly and Public Community:** Engage with historians, genealogists, students, and the public to gather input on the platform's design and to promote its use as an educational and research tool.

## Timeline for Project Implementation

Our project will be implemented in several phases to ensure the successful digitization and accessibility of executive clemency data from the New York State Archive.

### Phase 1: Preliminary Planning (1 month)
*   Conduct initial research and planning to determine project scope, requirements, and resource needs.
*   Identify key stakeholders and potential partners for collaboration.
*   Develop a detailed project plan, including timeline, budget, and deliverables.

### Phase 2: Digitization of Ledgers (3 months)
*   Procure necessary equipment and resources for digitization.
*   Commence scanning of all ledgers containing executive clemency information from the New York State Archive.
*   Monitor progress and address any technical issues or challenges as they arise.

### Phase 3: Data Entry and Quality Control (6 months)
*   Begin transcription of digitized clemency data into a structured spreadsheet format.
*   Implement quality control measures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the entered data.
*   Conduct regular reviews and audits of the data entry process to identify and address any discrepancies or errors.

### Phase 4: Database Development and Testing (2 months)
*   Develop a searchable database platform for storing and accessing the digitized clemency data.
*   Test the functionality and usability of the database, incorporating feedback from stakeholders as needed.
*   Fine-tune the database interface and search features to optimize user experience.

### Phase 5: Launch and Evaluation (1 month)
*   Officially launch the searchable database platform to the public and relevant stakeholders.
*   Monitor usage and gather feedback from users to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the database.
*   Make any necessary adjustments or improvements based on user feedback and usage data.

## Resources and Support Needs

*   **Funding for Scanning Services:** We require funding to purchase copies of the executive clemency documents from the New York State archive.
*   **Database Program:** We need access to an adequate database program capable of efficiently storing and organizing the data.
*   **Storage Capacity:** Adequate storage capacity is essential to hold the digitized data securely.
*   **Volunteers for Data Digitization:** We require a team of approximately 5-10 volunteers.
*   **Training and Supervision:** Providing training and ongoing supervision for volunteers.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Implementing quality assurance measures, such as double-entry verification.
*   **Technical Support:** Access to technical support services.

## Sustainability Plan

*   **Continuous Updates and Maintenance:** We will regularly update the database with new information.
*   **Expanded Use Cases:** The archive will benefit historians, genealogists, and students, in addition to legal researchers.
*   **User Engagement and Feedback:** We will actively engage with users to gather feedback and improve the platform.
*   **Promotion and Outreach:** We will implement targeted outreach to academic institutions, historical societies, and genealogical groups.
*   **Long-Term Sustainability Plan:** Our organization has a long-term plan for maintaining the database beyond the initial grant period, including seeking further academic and humanities-based funding.
