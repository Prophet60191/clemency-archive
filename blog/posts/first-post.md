# Welcome to the Clemency Archive Project Blog!

Welcome to our new blog! This is the place where we will share updates on our progress, highlight interesting findings from the archive, and post announcements for our community of volunteers and supporters.

We are thrilled to kick things off with some exciting news: we currently have a major prospective grant in the works. While we can't share the details just yet, we are incredibly optimistic about this opportunity to secure the resources needed to bring this entire project to life.

Thank you for being on this journey with us as we work to unlock this vital history. Stay tuned for more updates!
